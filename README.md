- 👋 Hi, I’m @giubodi [Giuliano Bonardi], from Italy, living in UK.
- 👀 I’m interested in Middleware Architectures, hoping to become an integration architect in the (near?) future.
- 💻 I'm currently a senior software engineer for Maersk Line in UK, working on the Middleware and Integration systems. 
- 💞️ I really like to travel around, caving (I'm also a caving instructor), diving, spend good time with my family and friends and of course my dogs!
